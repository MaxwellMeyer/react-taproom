Tap Room
Build a tap room in React where a bar or kombucha store can track their kegs. This could also be a soda fountain or another kind of tracker - as long as you're able to track the remaining amount and meet the objectives, you can be creative with this prompt.

Before getting started, plan out your application and draw a component tree or component diagram that shows the structure of your components. This is a requirement for the project and should be included in your README. You may draw the structure on a piece of paper and take a picture of it or use an application like https://www.draw.io/.

Keep in mind that you will only be expected to add CREATE and READ functionality, though you are welcome to implement full CRUD. Here are some user stories to get you started. The application should have the following functionality:

As a user, I want to see a list/menu of all available kegs. For each keg, I want to see its name, brand, price and abv%.
As a user, I want to submit a form to add a new keg to a list.
As a user, I want to be able to click on a keg to see its detail page.
As a user, I want to see how many pints are left in a keg. Hint: A full keg has roughly 124 pints.
As a user, I want to be able to click a button next to a keg whenever I sell a pint of it. This should decrease the number of pints left by 1. Pints should not be able to go below 0.

## Available Scripts

In order to start a development server and view the project in the browser:

1. Clone the repository
2. Navigate to the `tap-room` directory
3. Open code with preferred text editor
4. - Navigate to `tap-room` in the CLI
   - Run `npm install` command to install dependencies
   - Optional: Run `npm run build` command to bundle files
   - Finally, run the `npm run start` command to start a development server

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
